🚀 Unlocking Insights from Student Academic Data: A Data-Driven Approach 🚀
I recently worked on analyzing a dataset that tracks student performance across different academic programs. By digging into the data, I was able to uncover valuable insights that can help improve student success and education strategies.
🔍 Key Insights:
Performance Analysis: I analyzed students’ CGPA, pass rates, and categorized their performance (Low, Medium, High) to spot trends and identify where extra support is needed.
Demographic Breakdown: I looked at the gender and country distribution of students to understand diversity and suggest ways to make education more inclusive and supportive.
Program & Course Performance: I explored how different programs and course loads impact student success, revealing areas where students may need more resources.
Pass Percentage: I compared pass percentages across groups of students to better understand what drives academic success.
📊 What I Did:
Cleaned and organized the data to make it easy to analyze.
Created simple charts and graphs to present the data clearly and effectively.
Wrote a detailed, 10-page report with actionable recommendations on how to improve student outcomes.
This project helped me sharpen my Excel skills and deepened my passion for using data to solve real problems in education.
💡 What’s Next? I’m excited to keep using data to improve education and business decisions. Let’s connect if you want to discuss how data-driven insights can make a real difference!
